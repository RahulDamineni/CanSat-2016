# CanSat-2016
2016's problem statement involved building a glider. That too a miniature one!
Until then we had comfortable limits on total electronics weight and available space. 
That changed this time, though the required functionality increased (a little).

# Design Novelty
Owing to above constraints, we had to build the electronic subsystem from scratch using the bare-minimum components.
I managed to reduce board size by 86% while the power consumption was reduced by 45% when compared to previous year's design.
This will a 3.3V architecture running at 8MHz and tightly controlling sleep cycles of power hungry XBee Pro and powers off a 
bus of CR2032 without additional power conditioning circutary. 
Detatch mechanism (to seperate glider from container) is innovative too. 
We heated a Ni-Chrome wire using a seperate high current density Li-ion cell to cut threads holding the duo. 
Over-all the design turned out pretty compact
